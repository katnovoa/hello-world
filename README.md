# hello-world

hola hola,

I am Kat and Im teaching my self how to code. I started last year with 
web development and I must say its been quite the journey. I really get
overwhelme with the amount of information I need to learn. It was only
recently that I started hearing that a web developer #1 skill is learning 
how to google search wisely. Being able to ask the right questions is key. 
hoping that I can acomplish more things by the end of this year. I am giving
myself until july since I plan to move to Colorado. My goal for 2018 is that
I find an entry level job as a front-end web developer.
